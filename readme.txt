Automatically Add Image Title, Caption, Description And Alt Text From Filename. Includes a bulk updater to update existing images in the Media Library

== Description ==

Automatically add Image attributes such as Image Title, Image Caption, Description And Alt Text from Image Filename. 

The plugin can update image attributes for both new images and existing images in the media library. 

If your image filename is *my-image-name.jpg*, your Image Title, Caption, Description And Alt Text will be *My Image Name*. 

The plugin settings and bulk updater are in WordPress Admin > Settings > Image Attributes. Here you can choose which attributes to update for NEW uploads. 

**Please remember to take a database backup before running the bulk updater. The bulk updater updates ALL attributes for existing images in the Media Library and ignores the settings set for NEW uploads.**
